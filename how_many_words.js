// A sentence is made up of a group of words. Each wprd is a sequence of letters, ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z'), that may contain one or more hyphens and may end 
// in a punctuation mark: period (.), comma (,) question mark (?) or exclamation. Words will be separated by one or more white soace characters. Hyphens join 
// two words into one and should be retained while the other punctuation marks should be stripped. Determine the number of words in a 
// give sentence.


// Example 
// s = 'How many eggs are in a half-dozen, 13?'
// The list of words in the string is [How, many, eggs, are, in, a , half-dozen] and the number of words is 7. Notice that the numeric string, '13'
//  is not a word because it is not within the allowed character set.

// example 1
// input = he is a good programmer, he won 865 competitions, but sometimes he dont.What do you think ? All test - cases should pass.Done - done ?
// output = 21

// example 2

// input = jds dsaf lkdf kdsa fkldsf, adsbf ldka ads ? asd bfdal ds bf[l.akf dhj ds 878  dwa WE DE 7475 dsfh ds  RAMU 748 dj.
// output = 21
